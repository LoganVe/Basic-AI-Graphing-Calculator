# Basic-AI-Graphing-Calculator
Here's a simple example of how you could write a Python program that works as a graphing calculator:

This code will graph the function f(x) = x^2 for x values ranging from -100 to 100. To graph a different function, you can simply define a new function and pass it as an argument to the graph function. For example, to graph the function f(x) = x^3, you could use the following code:

You can also adjust the range of x values that are graphed by modifying the x_range argument in the call to the graph function. For example, to graph the function for x values ranging from -50 to 50, you could use the following code:
